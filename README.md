### FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why choose React over XYZ?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Most other options are specific to the web.</li>
    <li>Flutter doesn't support desktop, and while the code is native, it only emulates native UI.</li>
    <li>No other framework lets us natively target desktop and mobile, while maintaining web support.</li>
  </ul>
