    <li>Most other options are specific to the web.</li>
    <li>Flutter doesn't support desktop, and while the code is native, it only emulates native UI.</li>

    <li>It's necessary to be able to snapshot the state of the app.</li>
    <li>If you love Observables, this project is not for you.</li>
